      <span>Hello! My name is Simon. Thank you for checking out my portfolio. I have <br />
        been on this coding adventure for about one year now. I enjoy creating <br />
        aesthetic web-apps, and am planning on learing mobile development soon. My <br />
        stack includes: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, Axios, Node, and MongoDB.</span>
